## Product Backlog

### Prioritization Methodology: MoSCoW
- **Must Have**: Features critical to the core functionality of LTI-ATS.
- **Should Have**: Important but not critical features that enhance usability.
- **Could Have**: Nice-to-have features that can be deferred if time/resources are limited.
- **Won't Have**: Features deferred to future iterations.

### Backlog Items
1. **User Story 1: Job Posting and Distribution** (Must Have)  
   - Rationale: Essential for initiating the recruitment process and maximizing candidate reach, aligning with the high-priority functionality outlined in the PRD.
2. **User Story 2: Candidate Screening and Ranking** (Must Have)  
   - Rationale: Critical for efficient candidate selection, leveraging AI to reduce manual effort, a key competitive advantage of LTI-ATS.
3. **Use Case 3: Interview Scheduling and Feedback** (Should Have)  
   - **As a** Recruiter  
   - **I want to** schedule interviews and collect feedback from interviewers  
   - **So that** I can coordinate the hiring process and make informed decisions  
   - **Acceptance Criteria:**  
     - The system proposes interview times based on calendar integration.  
     - Candidates confirm slots, and interviewers are notified.  
     - Feedback is collected via scorecards within 24 hours post-interview.  
     - Process completes within 5 minutes per scheduling request.  
   - **Priority:** Medium  
   - **Estimated Effort:** 10 story points  
   - Rationale: Enhances collaboration and efficiency but depends on prior candidate selection.
4. **Reporting and Analytics** (Could Have)  
   - **As a** HR Manager  
   - **I want to** generate reports on hiring metrics (e.g., time-to-hire, source effectiveness)  
   - **So that** I can make data-driven strategic decisions  
   - **Acceptance Criteria:**  
     - The system provides customizable report templates.  
     - Reports are generated in PDF format within 1 minute.

## Effort Estimation
- **Methodology**: Fibonacci Sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc.) using Story Points  
- **Reasoning**: Fibonacci allows for non-linear effort estimation, reflecting the increasing complexity and uncertainty as tasks grow larger. Story points provide a relative measure independent of time, accommodating varying team velocities.  
- **Units**: Story Points  
- **Breakdown**:  
  - ATS-001: 5 points (moderate complexity due to NLP integration)  
  - ATS-002: 6 points (higher complexity with AI model training)  
  - ATS-003: 2 points (simpler UI task with existing framework)  
  - Total for User Story: 13 story points  

## Notes
- Estimates are based on a collaborative planning poker session with developers, considering dependencies and potential risks (e.g., data accuracy, API latency).
- Adjustments may be needed post-sprint based on actual velocity and feedback.
